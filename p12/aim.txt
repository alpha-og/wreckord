Input a list of processes, their CPU burst times (integral values), arrival times, and priorities. Then simulate the following scheduling algorithms on the process mix:\\
(a) FCFS\\
(b) SJF\\
(c) SRTF\\
(d) non-preemptive priority (a larger priority number implies a higher priority)\\
(e) RR (with a quantum of 3 units).\\
Determine which algorithm results in the minimum average waiting time (over all processes).\\
