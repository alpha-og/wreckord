At one instant, the memory map of a 4MB (4000KB) RAM looks as in Figure 1. Processes (P1, P2, etc.) request the operating system for memory and also release the allocated memory after completing execution, A sample execution trace is shown below: \\
\\
P7 requests for 115 KB\\
P10 requests for 650KB\\
P3 completes execution\\
P1 completes execution\\
P6 completes execution\\
P8 requests for 200KB\\
P5 completes execution\\
P2 completes execution\\
P9 requests for 37KB\\
P10 completes execution\\
P9 completes execution\\
P4 completes execution\\
