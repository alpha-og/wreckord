1. Start\\
2. Read the "available" vector\\
3. Read the number of processes, "np" and number of distinct resource types, "nr"\\
4. Read the "allocated" and "max" matrices for each process from the user\\
5. Compute the "need" matrix subtracting the allocation from the max\\
6. Initialize vector "completed" (having as many elements as the number of processes) \hspace*{0.4cm} to false\\
7. Initialize vector "work" (having as many elements as the number of distinct resource \hspace*{0.4cm} types) to available\\
8. Initialize vector "sequence" (having as many elements as the number of processes) to \hspace*{0.4cm} store the safe sequence\\
9. Search "completed" for an element whose value is false having need less than work\\
10. If no such element exists, goto step-14\\
11. Add the "allocated" vector of the process to the "work" vector\\
12. Update the completed flag of the process to true\\
13. Append the process id/ name into "sequence" and goto step-9\\
14. If all entries of the "completed" vector are true, system is in safe state, goto step-16\\
15. Else, system is in unsafe state, goto step-17 \\
16. Output the safe sequence\\
17. Stop\\
