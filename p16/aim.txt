Create a command listdir that works like the ls command and will be invoked as listdir path where path is the path of some directory in your system. The output should be a list of files and directories in that path along with the following information for each file or directory:\\
• file permissions and file-type information\\
• the user identity of the file owner\\
• the time of last access\\
• the time of last modification to contents.\\
You may have to use system calls like "opendir()", "readdir()", "stat()" etc.\\
