Simulate the address translation in the paging scheme as follows: The program receives three command line arguments in the order,\\
• size of the virtual address space (in megabytes)\\
• page size (in kilobytes)\\
• a virtual address (in decimal notation)\\
The output should be the physical address corresponding to the virtual address in ⟨ frame number, offset⟩ format. You may assume that the page table is implemented as an array indexed by page numbers. (NB: If the page table has no index for the page number determined from the virtual address, you may just declare a page table miss!)\\
